Queries are taken from https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/pg-tpch
<!-- First, you need to install https://github.com/RelationalAI-oss/tpch-dbgen/

Then, change your current directory to `dbgen`

Finally, you can generate the TPC-H queries using the following command:

```
for i in {1..22}; do DSS_PATH=/tmp DSS_QUERY=../queries ./qgen -r 1 -s 1 $i > $i.sql; done
``` -->
